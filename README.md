# Cloud-Native E-Commerce Microservices Platform

This project is developed as the **DEPI Final Graduation Project (DevOps Track)**.  
It demonstrates the design and implementation of a production-ready, cloud-native e-commerce platform built using microservices architecture and complete DevOps automation practices.

## Project Overview

The platform consists of multiple backend services, a frontend application, and supporting infrastructure components, all fully containerized and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster with automated CI/CD pipelines.

The main objective of this project is to showcase practical DevOps skills including:

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Configuration Management (Ansible)
- Containerization (Docker)
- Orchestration (Kubernetes)
- CI/CD Automation (Jenkins)
- Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
- Security Scanning (Trivy, SonarQube)
- Cloud Deployment (AWS/Azure)

## Key Features

- Microservices-based architecture (Product, User, Order services)
- Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
- Blue-Green / Canary deployment strategy
- Auto-scaling using Kubernetes HPA
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Secure container image scanning
- Infrastructure provisioning via Terraform
- Production-ready architecture with load balancing and SSL

## Objective

To simulate a real-world enterprise DevOps environment by building, automating, deploying, monitoring, and maintaining a scalable cloud-native application from development to production.
